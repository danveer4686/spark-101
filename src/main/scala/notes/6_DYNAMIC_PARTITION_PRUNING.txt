SELECT t1.c1,t1.c2 FROM t1
INNER JOIN t2
ON t1.c1==t2.d1
WHERE t2.d2 = 'something'

spark 2.x Static-Partitioning-Pruning
- It uses predicate pushdown and reads only t2-records having t2.d2 = 'something'

spark 3.x Dynamic-Partitioning-Pruning
- It creates dynamic predicate for t1 as well and reads only t1-records which can join with filtered t2 records
