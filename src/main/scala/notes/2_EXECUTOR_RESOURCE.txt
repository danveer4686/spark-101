6 machines
- 16 cores and 64 gb ram

leave 1 core and 1 gb on each machine for OS related operations

It has been observed that 5 cores per executors works very well
15 cores/ 5 cores = 3 executors on each machine

63gb / 3 = 21 gb per executor
leave 2 gb for yarn overhead memory (Used for spark optimisations, better suffling of df, keeps all the required strings in hash table)
