StaticAllocation:
- Executors are not killed hence any data written by executor1 can be read by executor2 by accessing metadata (where to read data from) on executor1

DynamicAllocation:
- After writing data, executor1 can be killed by YARN (as per idle time policy). Metadata will also be deleted and other executors cant read this data
- Hence we should always enable external shuffle service in case of dynamic allocation

ExternalShuffleService:
- Shuffle writes and shuffle reads will happen through this service. Even if executor is killed, metadata will be available in external service.
- Enable it in yarn-site.xml
