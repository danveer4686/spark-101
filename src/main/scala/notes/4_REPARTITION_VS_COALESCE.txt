Coalesce:
- Coalesce can merge partitions and reduce total no. of partitions without shuffling data across machines
- It can result in un-even distribution of data (Data skewed)

Repartition:
- It can reduce or increase total no. of partitions
- It evenly distributes data but shuffling across machines becomes slow
