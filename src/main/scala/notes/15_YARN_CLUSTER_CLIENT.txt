Client:                                                 Cluster:
- Driver runs on edge node where job is submitted from  - Driver runs on any machine on cluster

Edge node:
- Not part of the cluster
- Bridge between cluster and outside network
- Many helpful tools like oozie, hue, sqoop are installed here without disturbing actual cluster
- Aggregated results can be kept here to be used by other teams like BI/DataScience so that other teams will not use main cluster
