Driver OOM error:
- Collect operation : all the partitions of the dataframe will go to driver program
                      => driver tries to merge all parts in one hence OOM
- Broadcast huge data : driver needs to merge all the parts and send across the executors
                        => merging can cause driver go OOM

Executors OOM error:
- Scewed data : One very large partition which single executor cant handle
- Too much parallelism : Too many cores on single executor will result very less
                        => yarn overhead memory (Used for spark optimisations, better suffling of df, keeps all the required strings in hash table)
                        => It will result in executor OOM
