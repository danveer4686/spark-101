Dataframe:
- Collection of records where each record is an object of sql.ROW class. Column names, type are not known at compile time.
Datasets:
- Collection of records where each record is an typed object of any known case class. Column names, type are known at compile time.
- More Memory efficient

df.filter(x=> x.age >10) --wont work. compile error.
ds.filter(x=> x.age >10) --works fine. no compile error.


Transformations vs Actions:
- Operations like map filter on a dataset will give another dataset. These are called transformations. Lazy
- count, collect, show are called actions. Will mostly return type other than dataset. Not lazy
